This project is inspired by Bomberman and was made for the intention of learning C++ and DirectX11. This project is not for sale.

By reading this that means I have finally finished this project without adding another feature or two! This is huge as i would have been done months ago, but would have much less to show for it.

When I Started this project back in December 2013, I had just finished learning C++ from a couple of text books over the months before. I had the drive to make a game in C++ so i looked into Cryengine. 
After about a week i realized that i had no idea how to start programming using that engine. There were no tutorials or any guides to get me started, but that's when i stumbled upon a DirectX11 tutorial. 
So within a month had a prototype engine that could generate 2D, 3D, GUI and sound!

With this new engine i decided to try to make a "small" project to help me learn how to code in C++ and also make a game at the same time. During the design period i learn countless new ways to program!
I learned about callbacks, A* pathfinding, Shaders, how to draw objects on a screen and much much more!
I loved this project and am sad its over, but am really looking forward to what ever is next.

Thank you for checking this out, it really means the world to me.
